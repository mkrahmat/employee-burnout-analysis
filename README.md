# Employee Burnout Analysis & Prediction (VOIS Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores **employee burnout issues** in product- and service-based companies.  
It uses **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning techniques** to analyze patterns and predict burnout levels among employees.

The goal is to help organizations â€” from **startups** to even **global health bodies like WHO** â€” understand and proactively address employee burnout.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Employee burnout is a critical issue impacting productivity, mental health, and retention rates.  
The objective of this project is to:
1. **Analyze** employee data to identify burnout patterns.
2. **Predict** burnout scores using machine learning.
3. Provide actionable insights to organizations.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **File:** `employee_burnout_analysis-AI.csv`
- **Columns:**
  - Employee ID  
  - Date of Joining  
  - Gender  
  - Company Type  
  - WFH Setup Available  
  - Designation  
  - Resource Allocation  
  - Mental Fatigue Score  
  - Burn Rate *(target variable)*
- **Size:** 22,750 records  
- **Source:** Provided as part of a **VOIS project/training assignment**.

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Data analysis & modeling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**:
  - Preprocessing (`LabelEncoder`, `SimpleImputer`)
  - Machine Learning Models (`AdaBoostRegressor`, `RandomForestRegressor`)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (`PCA`)

## ðŸ“Š Steps in the Project
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Filled missing values (mean imputation)  
   - Removed irrelevant columns (`Employee ID`)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Count plots for categorical features  
   - Histograms for numerical features  
   - Correlation heatmap

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Label encoding for categorical columns  
   - Normalization of feature names

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Applied **PCA** to reduce dimensionality while retaining 95% variance

5. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Implemented **AdaBoost Regressor** & **RandomForest Regressor** for burnout prediction

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Mental Fatigue Score** and **Resource Allocation** show strong correlation with burnout.
- Burnout levels vary across **company types** and **WFH setup availability**.
- PCA reduced the feature space while preserving most information.
